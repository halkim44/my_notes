## Relational database

**relational database** is a database organized according to the relational model of data.

### Relational database management system(RDBMS)

RDBMS is essentially a software app or system for managing relational database. allows user to interact with a database by issuing commands using syntax that conforms to a certain set of convention.

example of RDBMS:

- SQLite
- MS SQL
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL

## NoSQL

systems using non-relational data storage and retrieval models.

example:

- MongoDB (uses a document-oriented data storage model)

## SQL

stands for **Structured Query Language** is the programming language used to communicate with a relational database.

SQL is a declarative language; when you write and an SQL statement you describe what needs to be done not exactly how to do it.
